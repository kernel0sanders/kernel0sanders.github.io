        <p class="hobbies">I started taking photos in search of something I could do by myself. I enjoyed the images I was composing on my phone, so I figured I was ready to jump into the real thing. At first I was learning everything on a digital camera - much cheaper to practice compared to shooting on film - but eventually found my way into carrying around an analog Nikon camera. Friends, family, and especially my dogs were all held on notice of my lens at all times. To get the quality of images I was seeing in magazines and online, I had to practice over, and over, and over again; so that's what I did. Now, fast forward a few years and I am more than comfortable with just about any camera in my hands, and about the only time I shoot is spent with a film camera. The process, the patience, the emotion that comes from developed film; it always keeps me coming back. </p>
